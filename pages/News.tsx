            Jerome Powell's Dilemma: What If the Drivers of Inflation Are Here
            to Stay?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Federal Reserve chairman gathers with policy makers this week at
            Jackson Hole where they face the prospect that rising prices could
            be a feature of the landscape, a rapid about-face from a time when
            they worried about inflation being too low.

            Derby's Take: Economists See Powell Quashing Hopes for Rate Cuts
            Over Long Term
          </h2>
          <p>
            There is a case for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to be vague during
            his speech on Friday, because there is still more inflation data
            arriving before the next FOMC meeting.

          <h2>Laid-Off Workers Are Quickly Finding Jobs</h2>
          <p>
            People losing their jobs are rapidly landing interviews, multiple
            offers and higher pay, a dynamic of the tight labor market that is
            holding down unemployment totals.
